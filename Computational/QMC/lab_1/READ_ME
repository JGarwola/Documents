how to use "statfor":

  input:  a string of data from the stantard input

  output: 1) on the standard output: average, variance, correlation time,
             effective number of points and statistical error on the average;
          2) on file 'histo.out': a 101-bin histogram of the data;
          3) on file 'corr.out': the data autocorrelation function;
          4) on file 'blocking.out': the reblockin analysis of the data.

  the definition of all the above quantities is given in "statfor.pdf".

Exercises with direct sampling:

0) Sample uniform distributions of integer or real numbers.
   Plot data histograms, calculate average and variance as a function of
   the number of data.

1) Transform uniform random numbers to sample different distributions:

   * sample integers in (1,k) with non-uniform probability (tower sampling)

   * sample exp(-x)

   * sample (x^k)/(k+1) in (0,1)

   * sample a gaussian (google "Box Muller")

   * sample a gaussian using the central limit theorem

2) Monte Carlo calculation of integrals:

   * calculate A_circle/A_square;
     analyze the statistical error as a function of the number of data

   * calculate \int_0^1 x^gamma dx sampling pi(x)=1 for gamma=1, -0.4, -0.8;
     note the effect of infinite variance for gamma=-0.8

   * calculate \int_0^1 x^(-0.8) (up to a factor A) 
     sampling a distribution proportional to x^(-0.7);
     show that importance sampling removes the divergence of the variance;
     how would you calculate the factor A?

Metropolis sampling

0) sample a gaussian with moves uniformly distributed around the current 
   position.

1) calculate ground state properties of the harmonic oscillator;
   analyze the results (averages, statistical errore, equilibration times,
   autocorrelations as a function of the size of the move).

2) modify the harmonic oscillator code to calculate ground state properties of
   the Hydrogen atom.
